# Blender Resolve LUT

A collection of LUTs (.cube files) inspired by DaVinci Resolve’s **Filmic Resolve** styles, ready to use in Blender for color grading and contrast adjustments.

## 📦 What’s Included

This repository contains several LUTs in `.cube` format, covering different contrast variations:

- Filmic Resolve – Base Contrast  
- Filmic Resolve – Base Encoding to Scene Linear  
- Filmic Resolve – Filmic Shaper to Chromatic Attenuated  
- Filmic Resolve – High Contrast  
- Filmic Resolve – Low Contrast  
- Filmic Resolve – Medium High Contrast  
- Filmic Resolve – Medium Low Contrast  
- Filmic Resolve – Open Domain to Filmic Shaper  
- Filmic Resolve – Scene Linear to Base Encoding  
- Filmic Resolve – Very High Contrast  
- Filmic Resolve – Very Low Contrast

## 🎨 Usage in Blender

1. **Download or clone** this repository.  
2. Open **Blender** and go to the **Compositor** or **Color Management** section.  
3. Add a node setup that supports LUTs (e.g., `Color → LUT`).  
4. Load one of the `.cube` LUTs from this repo.  
5. Adjust mix/strength to taste.  

> 💡 These LUTs are most effective when combined with Blender’s Filmic view transform or a similar linear workflow.

## ⚙️ Notes

- Currently, the repo provides LUTs only (no add-on/installer).  
- Designed mainly for contrast/look variations inspired by **Filmic Resolve**.  
- You may need to tweak depending on your lighting and scene setup.
